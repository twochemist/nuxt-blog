### Hey, I'm Antonio, a Programmer based in Germany 🍺
I've been making applications in `JavaScript`🌐 , `Python`🐍 and `C++`🦾. From time to time, during my spare time I code [pet projects](/projects) and usually even [write](/posts) about it. 

### Always playing around with Tech.
  Dabbling into experimental cutting edge new technologies, I've been in love with software development for over half my life. It's a space of constantly changing and exciting new technology. This is a list of technologies that I've become interested in: 

#### 💻 Front-end Dev

Static and dynamic websites with frameworks in JavaScript `Vue.js` | `React`. Build web app and hosting. Adding authentification to app. Database communications and API solutions.

#### 👨‍💻 Back-end Dev
Applications with server-side JavaScript `Node.js` | Python `Django`. Deploy web app and set up for access. Create serverless backend. Storage Database in MySQL and MongoDB.

#### 🤖 Embedded Systems
Arduino Hub. Not afraid of surface-mount components and can assembly anything by hand. ARM-based µControllers. Have developed firmware for maker applications coded in `C`.


#### 🧠 Machine Learning
Data analysis, clustering, gradient boosting and deep learning. `Python` frameworks: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras. Image recognition and self driving cars.
