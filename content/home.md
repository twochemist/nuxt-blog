### Hey, I'm a programmer based in Germany - EU. 
I've been making hobby projects in `Python` | `C++` and web applications with `JavaScript`. From time to time I code personal [projects](/projects) and even [write](/posts) about it.

### Always playing around with Tech.
I've been in love with Web Development for over half my life. It's a space of constantly changing and exciting new technology. This is a list of technologies that I've become interested in:

#### 💻 Front End Development

Static and dynamic websites with frameworks in `JavaScript` (Vue.js | Angular). Build web app and hosting. Adding authentification to app. Database communications and API solutions.
#### 👨‍💻 Back End Development
Applications with server-side `JavaScript` (Node.js) | `Python` (Django). Deploy web app and set up for access. Create serverless backend. Storage Database in MySQL and MongoDB.

#### 🤖 Embedded Systems
Arduino Hub. Not afraid of surface-mount components and can assembly anything by hand. ARM-based µControllers. Have developed firmware for maker applications coded in `C/C++`.
